# Generative-AI-for-World-of-Warcraft-Quests
This project was inspired by Google's Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/journeys/118

API and web scraping to get text data for 27,793 World of Warcraft quests. Using tensorflow, building and training a generative text model to create new quests.
The dataset is availible on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kacperrawicki1/world-of-warcraft-quests.

API and Web scraping notebooks are for creating the Final Data CSV.
By default, the model notebook trains a fresh model. The pretrained weights are availible to load as desctitle_weights.h5
